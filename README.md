Say goodbye to the VIT Firewall restrictions and hello to secure file sharing.

Our team is working on developing an online file sharing platform that prioritizes security and privacy.
With end-to-end encryption, users can upload files of any extension onto our server, and the system will generate a unique key that is automatically included in a link.
This link can then be accessed using a QR code when the user is back on their personal computer.

For added security, all files are saved temporarily on the server for a specified duration, after which the data is automatically and permanently deleted. This service allows users to access their files outside of the VIT Firewall without compromising their privacy.
